In order to make it work you need to download the train/test dataset provided in a Kaggle competition. You can find it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/vehicle/data) (You need to have a Kaggle account).

After that configure the path constants at the begining of the Jupyter notebook to point to your workspace and dataset locations.
